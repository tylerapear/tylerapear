# Hey! I'm Tyler Pearson.
<!--
**tylerapear/tylerapear** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ The project I'm currently working on is [NESY-Engine](https://github.com/tylerapear/NESY-Engine), a 2D game engine for creating NES-style games
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning open-source by making my first contributions to small projects, and inviting others to collaborate on my projects.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to have more people to collaborate with on [NESY-Engine](https://github.com/tylerapear/NESY-Engine)! It's a fairly new project, and there is lots of work to do!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have 2 hilarious cats named Zora and Loki
