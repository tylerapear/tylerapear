# Learning Cycle 1: September 20, 2025 - ?

## Today I worked on:
- NESY-Engine PR [#36](https://github.com/tylerapear/NESY-Engine/pull/36)
- Learning about NIST's [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn)

## Today I learned:
- Python type hints: a way to indicate to developers and tools like linters/IDEs what type of value a parameter expects. Formatted as def function(property: typeHint):

  ```bash
  def render(self, screen: pygame.Surface):
    surface = pygame.Surface((self._width, self._height), pygame.SRCALPHA)
  ```
- OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) is a machine-readable standard for managing cybersecurity compliance assessments. It's a schema 
- UUIDs are Universally Unique Identifiers; 128 character IDs that are astronomically unlikely to interfere with any other identifier even across systems 


## Established goals for each learning cycle:
1) Contribute to my main project
2) Learn about a new technology to
3) Contribute to someone else's project

## Goals Completed:
1) Contribute to my main project: added creature-screen continuity in NESY-Engine
2) Learn about a new technology: MCP
3) Contribute to someone else's project: working on [CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/Shashankss1205/CodeGraphContext?tab=readme-ov-file)
